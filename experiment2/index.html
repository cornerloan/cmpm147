			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>This experiment creates generated art based off of the image.</p>
			<p>The image has a few key features: trees, a mountain, a pink and blue sky, and a river.</p>
			<p>I added a cloud and sun to add life to the image.</p>
		</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I had to split this up into multiple sections.</p>
				<p>The Trees surround the river, so I created a river and sprinkled trees on both sides of the river.</p>
				<p>The river itself is a cascade of rounded edge rectangles, which move around left and right to show a winding river.</p>
				<p>The mountain is a single line with bumps added to simulate ridges.</p>
				<p>The sky is a pink box, with random blue opacity ellipses added to simulate a sunset.</p>
				<p>The clouds move based on time, and loop through the sky.</p>
				<p>The sun moves in the sky based on a sin wave, and moves X position based on the X position of the mouse.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This project started out easy, thanks to the code provided. The mountain and trees use the same code as the provided example.</p>
				<p>I added a river, and made it wind which actually didn't take too long. Afterwards, I had to make sure trees weren't inside the river. I changed this by tweaking the tree placement to not include the middle third of the canvas.</p>
				<p>Next, I added the cloud which moves to the right based on time, and loops back to the left side once the right side of the canvas is reached.</p>
				<p>The sun took a while, but overall I learned a lot about manipulating sin waves based on how I want objects to move in an arch.</p>
				<p>Overall, I'm not too happy with the opacity of the blue and pink sky. I wish I knew a better way to implement the opacity, but the level of quality matches the rest of the basic shapes of the project</p>
