				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The purpose of this experiment is to learn how Glitch works, and figure out how to import a project
				from glitch over to this github developed webpage. The program gives the reader a random mission to do in 
				helldivers, along with generated equipment.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I created several different arrays for grouping similar terms. A function replacer() will choose one word from each 
				array and assign it to a prewritten script.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working on this project through Glitch wasn't too difficult. This is my first javascript project, so there was a bit of learning
				to do with correct syntax. The biggest issue was importing this assignment from Glitch to Github, but the problems were slowly solved
				and I am proud of the work I have done so far.</p>
